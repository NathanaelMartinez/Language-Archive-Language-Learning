# Language Archive

Immersive learning is one of the best ways to learn a spoken language, so Language Archive provides an open audio database for users to access and contribute to.

## Features
Aspiring language learners have access to a database of crowd-sourced scenario translations. Native speakers may also contribute their own translations for others to use.

After logging in, users can access the database in one of two ways: 
either as a **language learner**, or as a **content provider.** 

Language learners can select from a list of fully translated scenarios in their language of choice.
Language learners can either type their answer, or use the appâ€™s speech-to-text feature to gauge their pronunciation.
If stumped on a scenario, users can reveal the answer and playback the provided audio for the scenario.  

Content providers can access untranslated scenarios and contribute their own translations.
When providing translations, users are required to add both text and audio translations.
