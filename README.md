## Motivation
Language Archive is a mobile application designed with a primary focus on the following:
* immersive learning
* open crowd-sourced database.
Immersive learning is one of the best ways to learn a spoken language, so Language Archive provides an open audio database for users to access and contribute to.

## How to Use
Aspiring language learners have access to a database of crowd-sourced scenario translations. Native speakers may also contribute their own translations for others to use.

After logging in, users can access the database in one of two ways: 
either as a language learner, or as a content provider. 

Language learners can select from a list of fully translated scenarios in their language of choice. These scenarios allow language learners to practice their speaking skills for various situations. 

Alternatively, content providers can access untranslated scenarios and contribute their own translations. These translations will aid others in their learning.

When practicing the provided scenarios, language learners can either type their answer in, or use the appâ€™s speech-to-text feature. 

If you're stumped on a scenario, you can reveal the answer and playback the audio for the scenario. 

Both features add to the immersive language experience - speech-to-text allows users to practice their pronunciation, while the audio playback helps users hear the translations from a native speaker.

These audio recordings are provided by other contributing users. When providing translations, users are required to add both text and audio translations. These translations apply to both prompt and answer, thus allowing the language learner to fully understand the scenario.
